# Kramers_Moyal_coefficients-Matrixequations-MARY.ipynb
This notebook is based on the following article: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10990  This article examines random systems and their statistical calculations using Kramermoyal coefficients and moments. In this notebook (Kramers_Moyal_coefficients-MatrixequationsÙ€MARY.ipynb), according to the equations that we will write below, we will calculate a matrix equation, then calculate D and finally draw it.

In the next notebook (Kramers_Moyal_coefficients-Bins_MARY.ipynb), we will calculate D based on equations 2 and 3
